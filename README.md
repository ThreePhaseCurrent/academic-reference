# academic-reference
The project was written as a college thesis in 2019.
Outdated Winforms technology is used. 

<strong>The purpose of the system</strong> is to automate the duties of an employee of the training unit.

# Short description
The program was developed by order for an educational institution. Used in the creation of academic reference for students who have been expelled, transferred to another educational institution, or have lost their diploma.

An academic reference is a document that contains the student's personal data, information on the direction of study, a list of subjects studied and their grades, as well as the reason for issuing the reference and places for stamps.

# Application work concept
The application should work on older computers with Windows XP and Windows 7 operating systems. The application should be easy to understand and learn.

An employee of the educational unit enters the student's personal data, chooses the direction of study and the subjects studied. Then grades are set for each subject, depending on its type of assessment (credit, exam, ZNO, practice, etc.). After that, you can create a reference in doc format.

Separation of rights for administrator and user is provided.
The application provides for making changes to the database tables in administrator mode. For example, if a new specialization or subject has been added.

It is possible to back up the database both to a local computer and to a remote server using FTP protocol.

You can save or preview the reference at the stage of filling out student data. Saving occurs in a separate directory in a folder with the name of the current user. You can continue filling out the reference at any other time.

To create help, the COM-object Word 2010 is used. Also in the application there is a help with a detailed step-by-step description of the application. SQLite is used as a database due to its ease of porting to any computer.
